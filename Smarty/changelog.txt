	##
	## BOOSTRAP 3
	## UPDATE NOTES: - this major version has a lot of changes but most of them are in JS and CSS files.
	##		 - html structure for Boostrap 3 is untouched so your existing project should not be affected.

	##		 - before you update your project, don't forget to create a backup!
	## 		 - estimated time to update an existing project: ~5 minutes (only a copy/paste is needed - read careful "Moved" below)
